Models and their associations:

	1. Seller => has many products
	2. User => has many orders
	3. Product => belongs to a seller, belongs to a category, has many product_orders (Using ProductOrder 	Model for many to many association between product and order).
	4. Category => Has many products
	4. Order => belongs to a user, has one payment has many product_orders (Using ProductOrder Model for many to many association between product and order).
	5. ProductOrder => Will act as join table for Product and Order model having one extra attribute/column as quantity. Belongs to a product, belongs to an order
	6. Payment => belongs to an order
	I haven't added various attributes of the models. You can change name of the associations if needed. 

Controllers:
	
	1. ProductsController (you can use the controller created by scaffold generator for this)
	2. CartsController 
	3. Payments COntroller
	4. UsersController (Separate controller for user for those actions that devise doesn't manage)
	5. GeneralController (or any other name that you would like to give)(optional)
	Use devise gem for authentication of both Users and sellers

	I have mentioned 5 controllers here so that you can place your code logically in different controllers.
	Like adding of product to cart and storing cart in session, all these actions can be written in CartsController. Any other miscellaneous feature can be placed in GeneralController.
